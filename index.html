    <h3>Java Developer</h3>
</div>
<p>
    As a professional with a strong background in programming, I have a particular proficiency in the Java language. I am not just a Java programmer, but also a proponent of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a coding paradigm that uses objects with data fields and associated procedures known as methods.
</p>
<br>
<p>
My knowledge doesn‚Äôt stop at OOP. I also have a deep understanding of data structures, a critical aspect of programming that involves storing and organizing data efficiently. This knowledge allows me to write code that is not only functional but also efficient and easy to understand.
</p>
<br>  
<p>  
In addition to these skills, I have some experience with Java FX, a software platform for creating and delivering desktop applications, as well as rich internet applications that can run across a wide variety of devices.

    <h3>Front-End Developer</h3>
</div>
<p>As a budding front-end developer, I have already gained substantial experience in the field. My proficiency in HTML and CSS has allowed me to create engaging and aesthetically pleasing websites. Despite being in the early stages of my career, I have managed to master these essential tools of web development. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning JavaScript, a powerful language that will enable me to add dynamic and interactive elements to my web pages. This continuous learning process is what keeps me passionate and excited about my work in web development.</p>

</div>
<p>Unfortunately, that‚Äôs all I have for now. But I promise you, the next time you visit my personal website, you‚Äôll find a plethora of services that I can offer you. üòä</p>
<br>
<p>By that time, I will have mastered JS and become a full-stack developer. The journey of learning never ends, and I‚Äôm excited about the endless possibilities that lie ahead.</p>
